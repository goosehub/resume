Points of Emphasis

Identity
My goal is to craft a unique and compelling identity.

Graphic Design
I create my own design elements. I use colors, fonts, images, and icons that work together.

Responsive Design
I design websites that run across all devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and televisions.

JQuery
I use JQuery to create natural animations to bring pages to life without breaking functionality

Ajax
When the situation calls for it, I use Ajax to make live interactive experiences and save bandwidth.

PHP
I use PHP for it's dedicated community and established language.

SEO and Access
I place important relevent content where search engines can see it, screen readers can read it, and older browsers can show it.

Documented Work
I write clean understandable code and document every step, issue, and goal to keep my projects running smoothly.

Gumbo YaYas
A local cajun restaurant that needed an upgrade to their website. I used animations to give the site a more natural, professional, and enjoyable feel. I made the site easy to maintain and alter, so the owners could make changes, advertise specials, or add content.
