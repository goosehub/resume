Resume and Work Showcase
Hi, I'm a web designer and developer based in Jacksonville, Florida. I love to create engaging front end designs and dependable back end development. I'm passionate about what I do. Let me tell you about it.

Points of Emphasis
Identity
I keep focus on the content, and work with clients to craft a unique and compelling identity.

Responsive Design
I design websites that run across all devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and televisions.

Semantic HTML
I create all of my presentation in the CSS, and leave the structure intact, giving a more reliable experience and easier to maintain projects.

JQuery
I use JQuery to create natural animations to bring pages to life without breaking functionality

Ajax
When the situation calls for it, I use Ajax to make live interactive experiences and save bandwidth.

PHP
I use PHP for it's large and dedicated community, and it's established and flexible language. I use the CodeIgniter framework to produce secure and maintainable websites, with clean URLs.

SEO and Access
I structure my HTML to have important relevent content where search engines can see it, screen readers can read it, and older browsers can show it.

Documented Work
I document every step and thoroughly comment my code to make my projects easy to maintain and troubleshoot.

Gumbo YaYas
A local cajun restaurant that needed an upgrade to their website. I added animations to give the site a more natural, professional, and enjoyable feel. I made the site easy to maintain and alter, so that the owners could make changes, advertise specials, or add content.
